# how does it all work
#### Data Preprocessing

- Loading and preprocessing image data.
- Augmenting images to increase dataset variability.

#### Model Creation and Training

- Implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Utilizing transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16.
- Compiling the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.

#### Model Evaluation

- Training the model with the training dataset.
- Evaluating the model performance using metrics like accuracy.

#### Predictions

- Making predictions on test images.
- Decoding the predicted labels.

#### Web Server Implementation

- Setting up a Flask web server for inference.
- Handling file uploads.
- Displaying classification results on uploaded images.
